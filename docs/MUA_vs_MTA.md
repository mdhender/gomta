# Understanding the Differences Between MTAs and MUAs

When it comes to sending and receiving emails, two important pieces of software are involved: **MTAs** and **MUAs**.
Let’s break down what these terms mean and how they differ, so you can understand their roles in the email process.

## What is an MTA?

An **MTA (Mail Transport Agent)** is responsible for **delivering** email from one server to another.
Think of it as the mail carrier in the email world—its job is to take the email you send, figure out where it needs to go, and deliver it to the right place.

MTAs are used by **mail servers**, not by the average user.
When you send an email, your email client (or **MUA**, which we’ll talk about next) gives the message to the MTA, and the MTA delivers it to the recipient’s mail server.

Examples of MTAs include:
- **Postfix**
- **Sendmail**
- **Exim**
- **GoMTA** (our project!)

In short, an MTA is used **behind the scenes** to manage email delivery between servers.

## What is an MUA?

A **MUA (Mail User Agent)** is the software that you use to **write, send, and receive** emails.
It’s the app or program you interact with directly—your email client.
Think of it as the post office on your computer or phone, where you can create messages, put them in envelopes, and send them on their way.

Popular MUAs include:
- **Outlook** (also known as Microsoft Mail or just "Mail" in some versions)
- **Gmail** (via web browser or mobile app)
- **Apple Mail**
- **Thunderbird**

Unlike MTAs, MUAs are designed for everyday users to manage their emails easily.

### Key Functions of a MUA:
- **Compose emails**: Write new emails and send them.
- **Receive emails**: Download and view emails sent to you.
- **Organize emails**: Sort, label, and archive your emails.

## The Relationship Between MTAs and MUAs

Here’s how these two work together:
1. When you **compose** and **send** an email using your MUA (e.g., Outlook or Gmail), the MUA sends that message to an MTA.
2. The MTA then figures out where the email needs to go and **delivers** it to the recipient’s mail server.
3. The recipient’s **MUA** (e.g., their own Gmail or Outlook) then **downloads** the email from their mail server so they can read it.

## Which One Do You Use?

If you’re simply looking to send, receive, and organize emails, you’ll be using a **MUA**—the email client you’re already familiar with, like Gmail or Outlook.
There’s no need to worry about setting up or interacting with an MTA; that’s handled in the background by mail servers and IT professionals.

### Recommended Email Clients (MUAs):

- **Outlook (or Microsoft Mail)**:
A popular email client for Windows and Mac, offering easy integration with Microsoft accounts and professional tools.
Outlook is part of the Microsoft Office suite, and "Mail" is the simplified version for Windows users.
  
- **Gmail**:
One of the most popular email services, Gmail can be used through any web browser or its dedicated mobile apps.
It’s free, easy to use, and widely accessible.

- **Apple Mail**:
Pre-installed on all macOS and iOS devices, Apple Mail is a user-friendly option for Mac and iPhone users.

- **Thunderbird**:
A free, open-source email client that supports multiple accounts and advanced customization for those who want more control over their email experience.

## Conclusion

In summary, MTAs and MUAs work together to ensure your emails are sent and received smoothly.
As a user, you interact with an **MUA** like Gmail or Outlook to manage your emails.
The **MTA** works in the background, handling the delivery of your messages from one mail server to another.

If you're just looking to send and receive emails, you only need to focus on using a reliable MUA like Outlook or Gmail.
