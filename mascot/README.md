```prompt
Create a lovable mascot for a software project called 'GoMTA', an MTA (Mail Transport Agent) written in Go. The mascot should be a playful, energetic gnome running to symbolize speed and quick delivery. The gnome is holding a mailbag, with letters spilling out as it runs, representing email delivery. The gnome wears a pointed hat adorned with a small Go programming language icon (such as the Gopher icon or a Go-themed badge). The mascot's color scheme is blue and white, inspired by the Go language, with accents of green or gold. The overall expression of the gnome should be joyful and excited, showcasing energy and reliability in mail transport. The art style should be modern and simple, suitable for both logo and full-body character use.
